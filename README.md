This is a MULTIPAGE SCHOOL WEBSITE that was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
While this project is not my original work, I am proud to say that I watched, coded and studied every single line of the project (and I still do).
It was quite challenging to watch a 3 hour video for several weeks, but it's been a great learning journey.
The next series of commits that will follow are modifications that I will be making to the projects to make them close to being mine.
